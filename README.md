A question I find myself being asked a lot is "What are the best coffee spots in Seattle?"
I also often have to ask myself "What drink did I get the last time I was at this coffee shop, and what did I think about it?"

Seattle Coffee Tracker helps users find the best coffee shops in Seattle and keep private notes on which drinks they've 
tried at their favorite spots, so you'll never have to guess where to go or what to order again.

## Getting Started

### Setup .env.local
